****** entab and detab program ******

What's the meaning of detab program ?

Give examples about it ?
	
for exp: 
kdk	dkkd	dkdk	dkk	kdd
kd	kdk	kd	k	dkkd

As you see, tabstop is 8 spaces(by default in *nix).

Detab: Fill proper spaces to fix tabsize
	
Entab: Fill tab to replace spaces.


Analyst ex1.20: Code written by ducanhng 20, March 2011.

Use bufferline to store a line, buffer to store many lines.

1. maxcolumn is used for counting space. Should I need it for calculation ? No, I don't need.
2. the program don't print correctly elements in buffer. Maybe I put wrong end of line ('\0'). It's ok right now.
3. Source code is too long (107 LOC)

Conclusion: This program is bad :(. Need to improve to version 2.

Version2: 

1. Use pointer replace array in function getline1().
2. If integer variable is assigned, is it correct ?
For exp: 
	int c;
	char d = '7';
	d = c;// is it correct ?
	c = d;// is it correct ?
What happen if declare int p[3];
then p[3] = 10;
print array p, show the display
3. Why use pointer to array pointer as argument in main(int argc, **argv) ?
What's happen if I use pointer in argv ? 

How can I apply pointer to array pointer in other case ?

4. detab 5 9
	5th is the first tabstop
	9th is the second tabstop
	17th, 25th, 33th ... are the next tabstop columns (if default tabstop is 8)
	...

It requires argv must be increment

if (c == '\t')
	if index < tabstop(index)
		spaces available = tabstop - index;
How to calculate tabstop.

Use lasttabstop as external variable ? Is it a good way. Any method to do this ?


int tabstop(index, char **argv)
{
	tabstop = 0;

	while (--argc > 0)
		if index < *++argv
			tabstop = *argv
			return tabstop
		tabstop = *argv
	while (index > tabstop)	
		tabstop += TABSIZE
	return tabstop
}
