Note for ex 5.18

1. What are the differents between dcl with direct-dcl ?
define:
dcl: declaration. Function dcl is used to parse declarator
direct-dcl: direct declaration. Function dir-dcl is used to parse direct declarator

So what are the differents between declarator with direct declarator ?
	declarator(dcl) is direct declarator, perhaps(optionals) preceded *'s . OK, so direct-dcl is also dcl.
	direct declarator(direct-dcl) name
			 (dcl)
			direct-dcl()
			direct-dcl[optional size]
Very clear !

2. How does the main function in the exercise work ? and order process ?

Ok, Now let's analyst the requirements of 5.18
before analysting, I have to understand all line of code in the example. It's very interesting program, and have a bit confuses. 

for exp: int (*pfa[3])() how to read it ?

pfa: is a name
pfa[3]: array[3] of 
*pfa[3]: array[3] of pointer to
int (*pfa[3])() array[3] of pointer to function returning to int 

3. Bugs

- Error appear when declare: int (*comp)(const char[])
Expected return: comp: pointer to function (const array of char) returning to int
